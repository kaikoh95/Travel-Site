# Travel-Site
Complete travel query web client and server created using node.js and vue.js for the front and back ends of this web application.

Currently only supports Desktop browsers; will be adding support for Mobile browsers in the future.

I have used Docker to run the backend server and deployed the web app on netlify - https://travel-review.netlify.com 

This is the repo used for automatically deploying the web app - https://github.com/kaikoh95/travel-reviewer

Run the 'docker-compose up' in db folder to set up the database via Docker and initialise it using the script provided.
